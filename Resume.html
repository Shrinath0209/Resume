                    I am a B.Tech Computer Science and Engineering student with a strong passion for web development and a keen interest in building modern, responsive, and user-friendly web applications. Over the course of my academic journey, I have developed a solid foundation in programming languages like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and frameworks such as React, Node.js, and Express.
I enjoy creating intuitive and functional websites that solve real-world problems. Through academic projects and personal practice, I’ve gained hands-on experience in both front-end and back-end development, as well as working with databases like MongoDB and MySQL. I'm constantly learning and keeping up with the latest trends in web technologies to improve my skills and stay ahead in the fast-paced tech landscape.
Currently, I’m seeking opportunities to further grow as a full-stack developer, contribute to meaningful projects, and be part of a team where I can apply my skills to create impactful digital experiences.
